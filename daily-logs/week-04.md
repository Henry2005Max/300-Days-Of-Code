## Day 21 - February 26
**Project:** TypeScript with Lodash for Arrays
**Time Spent:** 2hrs 33mins

### What I Built
- Student data demo: orderBy, groupBy, meanBy, filter, maxBy, minBy, countBy, uniqBy
- Product data demo: partition, groupBy, mapValues, sumBy, orderBy, pick, chunk, sortBy
- Array utilities demo: uniq, intersection, difference, flatten, zip, shuffle, take, takeRight
- Nigerian themed datasets (students from Lagos/Abuja/Kano, products priced in Naira)

### What I Learned
- Over 20 Lodash methods and when to use each
- _.groupBy for categorising data into buckets
- _.partition for splitting arrays into two groups
- _.mapValues for transforming grouped data summaries
- _.chunk for pagination logic
- _.zip for pairing two separate arrays together
- When Lodash beats plain JavaScript (readability and chaining)

### Resources Used
- Lodash documentation: https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15
- Lodash FP guide: https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide
- @types/lodash: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/lodash
