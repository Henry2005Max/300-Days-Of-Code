# Week 2 - Days 8-14

## Day 8 - February 13, 2026
**Project:** Currency Converter (NGN Focus + API)
**Time Spent:** 3 Hours

### What I Built
- NGN focused currency converter with live rates
- Supports 12 currencies including African ones (GHS, KES, ZAR)
- Live rates from exchangerate-api.com
- Fallback rates when API unavailable
- Quick NGN → USD reference table
- Convert any supported currency pair

### What I Learned
- Fetching live financial data from APIs
- Building fallback systems for when API fails
- Currency conversion mathematics
- Formatting numbers for currencies (JPY has no decimals!)
- Timeout handling for API calls
- African currency codes
- Building reference tables in terminal

### Challenges
- Understanding currency conversion through base rates
- Formatting different currencies correctly
- Building the fallback rate system
- Remembering tsconfig.json from the start

### Resources Used
- exchangerate-api.com documentation
- Currency codes reference (ISO 4217)
- Axios timeout documentation

### Tomorrow's Plan
- Day 9: TypeScript Encryption (crypto module)

## Day 9 - February 14, 2026
**Project:** TypeScript Encryption (crypto module)
**Time Spent:**

### What I Built
- Hashing tool (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512)
- AES-256 encryption and decryption
- Base64 encoder and decoder
- Caesar cipher (encrypt and decrypt)
- Secure random token generator
- UUID generator

### What I Learned
- Difference between hashing and encryption
- AES-256-CBC algorithm with IV
- Key derivation with scrypt
- Base64 is encoding not encryption
- Caesar cipher logic with shift
- Cryptographically secure random generation
- When to use each security method

### Challenges
- Understanding IV (Initialization Vector) in AES
- Key derivation from passwords
- Caesar cipher shift logic for both directions

### Resources Used
- Node.js crypto documentation
- AES encryption guide
- Crypto best practices

### Tomorrow's Plan
- Day 10: Review - Add Jest tests to Day 1 Calculator
