- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and power operations
- Has error handling for division by zero

### What I Learned
- How to set up a TypeScript project from scratch
- Using BigInt for handling very large numbers
- Working with readline for user input in Node.js
- Async/await patterns in TypeScript

### Challenges
- None

### Resources Used
- TypeScript documentation
- Node.js readline docs

### Tomorrow's Plan
- Day 2: Password Generator with crypto module

## Day 2 - February 7, 2026
**Project:** Secure Password Generator with Crypto Module  
**Time Spent:** 2.5 hours

### What I Built
- Cryptographically secure password generator
- Customizable length and character types
- Password strength analyzer
- Fisher-Yates shuffle for randomness

### What I Learned
